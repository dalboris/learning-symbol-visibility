# 02 - CMake Basics

In `01-gcc-basics`, we have seen how to control the visibility of a function
when compiling a shared library on Linux using GCC. Unfortunately, different
compilers and platforms handle this differently, therefore we need a more
robust solution. We see this solution here.

# 1. Compiling the shared library

We'll have a master `CMakeLists.txt` in this directory, and two subdirectories
`foo` and `bar` with their respective `CMakeLists.txt`. Let's start simple with
only the `foo` subdirectory and no explicit visibility:


./CMakeLists.txt:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1.0)
add_subdirectory(foo)
```

./foo/CMakeLists.txt:
```
add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
```

./foo/foo.h
```
#pragma once

int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mult(int a, int b);
```

./foo/foo.cpp
```
#include "foo.h"

int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int sub(int a, int b)
{
    return a - b;
}

int mult(int a, int b)
{
    return a * b;
}
```

Compile in a `build` directory with:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

You should get something like this on Linux:
```
$ cmake ../
